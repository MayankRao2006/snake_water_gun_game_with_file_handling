🐍 Snake, Water, Gun – Console Game (Python)
This is a simple Python-based terminal game where you play against the computer in a fun match of Snake 🐍, Water 💧, and Gun 🔫. The first one to score 3 points wins!

🎮 How to Play
Run the Python script snake_water_gun.py in your terminal or IDE.

You’ll be shown the rules and prompted to enter your move.

Choose your move by typing:

's' for Snake

'w' for Water

'g' for Gun

'q' to quit the game early

After each round, the winner is announced and points are updated.

The game continues until either you or the computer reaches 3 points.

📋 What You Should Know
Your moves and the results of each round are automatically saved in a file called snake_water_gun.txt.

This helps keep a simple history of the game — handy if you want to review who won which round.

The file is saved in the same folder as the game script.

💡 If you re-run the game multiple times, the results are added to the same .txt file unless you clear it yourself.
